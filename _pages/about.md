Hi! I'm Bobak, a postdoc at Harvard University in the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science department in Melanie Weber's group. Before this, I was a PhD student at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Originally from Philadelphia, I now live in Boston.

My research areas are related to machine learning and quantum computation. In quantum computation, my work focuses on learning the limits and capabilities of algorithms especially those related to quantum machine learning. On the classical side, I am interested in topics such as self-supervised learning and theoretically studying the role of geometry and symmetries in learning algorithms. 

My CV can be [found here](https://bkiani.github.io/files/BKiani_CV.pdf).

I'm always interested in meeting new people so please reach out to me if you want to chat. The best way to reach me is via email: bkiani at g.harvard dot edu
