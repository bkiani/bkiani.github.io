Hi! I'm Bobak, a PhD student at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My research areas are related to machine learning and quantum computation. My work focuses on learning the limits and capabilities of algorithms in both machine learning and quantum computation. Prior to MIT, I was an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University studying mechanical engineering and worked as a consultant at BCG. I grew up in Philadelphia and now live in Boston. 

My CV can be [found here](https://bkiani.github.io/files/BKiani_CV.pdf).

I'm always interested in meeting new people so please reach out to me if you want to chat. The best way to reach me is via email: bkiani at mit dot edu
