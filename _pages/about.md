I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Bowdoin College. I studied for my PhD at MIT in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. I was also a postdoc at Harvard University in the Applied Mathematics department. Originally from Philadelphia, I now live in Portland, Maine.

My research areas are related to quantum computation and machine learning. I focus on theoretical topics but stay in touch with practical questions as well. In quantum computation, my work focuses on learning the limits and capabilities of quantum algorithms. I have become very interested in questions on random Hamiltonians and average case complexity as I find these problems to be promising potential sources of quantum advantage. On the classical side, I am interested in topics in machine learning tied to physics and symmetry. 

My research interests:  
- **Quantum Algorithms:** I aim to understand the limits and capabilities of quantum algorithms especially in quantum machine learning.
- **Random Hamiltonians and Average Case Complexity:** I study random matrices in physics and mathematics and am very interested in these models as they are promising potential sources of quantum advantage.
- **Theory of Machine Learning:** I study deep learning algorithms focusing on those which incorporate physics and symmetries.
