Hi! I'm Bobak, a postdoc at Harvard University in the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science department in Melanie Weber's group. Before this, I was a PhD student at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Originally from Philadelphia, I now live in Boston.

My research areas are related to machine learning and quantum computation. In quantum computation, my work focuses on learning the limits and capabilities of algorithms especially those related to quantum learning and optimization. I have recently become more interested as well in studying average case complexity for quantum problems. On the classical side, I am interested in topics in machine learning tied to geometry and symmetry. 

You can find my articles on <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fz1mq4AAAAAJ&hl">my Google Scholar profile</a>.</u>
